#### Data Flow
1. **User Input**: Form data captured and validated client-side
2. **FHE Encryption**: Sensitive data encrypted using Zama instance before sending
3. **Smart Contract**: Encrypted operations performed on-chain without decryption
4. **Result Handling**: Encrypted responses processed and displayed to user
5. **Decryption**: User can decrypt their own data using private keys when needed

### Encryption Workflow

#### Deposit Process
1. User enters deposit amount in plain text
2. Frontend encrypts amount using Zama FHE
3. Encrypted amount sent to smart contract
4. Contract performs encrypted addition to user's balance
5. Balance remains encrypted on-chain

#### Interest Calculation
1. Contract reads encrypted principal balance
2. Calculates elapsed time since last accrual
3. Performs encrypted multiplication: `interest = principal √ó time √ó rate`
4. Updates user's accrued interest without revealing amounts

#### Withdrawal Process
1. User requests withdrawal amount (encrypted)
2. Contract verifies sufficient balance using encrypted comparison
3. Performs encrypted subtraction from balance
4. Transfers encrypted amount if sufficient funds available

## üîç How It Works

### The Privacy Problem in Traditional DeFi

Traditional DeFi protocols operate with complete transparency, meaning:
- All transaction amounts are publicly visible
- Account balances can be tracked by anyone
- Financial patterns and behaviors are exposed
- Privacy is non-existent for users

### ZamaBank's FHE Solution

**Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This means:

1. **Data Encryption**: All sensitive financial data is encrypted before being stored on-chain
2. **Encrypted Computation**: Mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) are performed directly on encrypted values
3. **Result Privacy**: Computation results remain encrypted until the authorized user chooses to decrypt them
4. **Selective Disclosure**: Users can prove computations were performed correctly without revealing the underlying data

### Interest Calculation Algorithm

```solidity
// Simplified interest calculation
uint256 elapsedSeconds = block.timestamp - lastAccruedAt[user];
euint64 principal = deposits[user];
euint64 interest = (principal * elapsedSeconds) / RATE_DENOMINATOR;
```

- **Rate**: 0.1% per day = 1/1000 per day = 1/(1000 √ó 86400) per second
- **Continuous Accrual**: Interest compounds every second, not just daily
- **Encrypted Operations**: All calculations performed on encrypted values
- **Precision**: Uses 6-decimal precision for accurate micro-interest calculations

### Security Model

#### Cryptographic Security
- **FHE Guarantees**: Computationally impossible to decrypt without private keys
- **Semantic Security**: Identical plaintexts produce different ciphertexts
- **Circuit Privacy**: Computation patterns don't leak information about inputs

#### Smart Contract Security
- **Access Control Lists (ACL)**: Zama's ACL system controls data access permissions
- **Overflow Protection**: SafeMath libraries prevent arithmetic vulnerabilities
- **Reentrancy Guards**: Protection against recursive call attacks
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs validated before processing

#### Operational Security
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: No single point of failure
- **Open Source**: All code publicly auditable
- **Immutable Contracts**: Deployed contracts cannot be modified maliciously
- **Testnet Deployment**: Reduced risk for experimental features
